This is a website for the artist Sam Keogh.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The frontend uses Next JS 14 and the App Router and styled with Panda CSS. Structured Content is managed by [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) CMS. This project is written in Typescript.

## Configuration

Refer to the .env.example within the project directory to setup the necessary environment variables.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
